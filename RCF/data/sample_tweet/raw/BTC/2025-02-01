We present an innovative \"eternal compression\" algorithm based on a 48GB four-level dictionary and pair hash marking. This approach combines multi-level coding with an adaptive dictionary to achieve high compression ratios for heterogeneous data. -- How the Algorithm Works 1. Splitting Data into 2-Bit Blocks The original data is transformed into a sequence of 2-bit blocks. For example, the byte 0xA3 (10100011 in binary) is broken into four blocks: 2, 2, 0, 3. This creates the basis for subsequent hierarchical processing. 2. Multi-level compression The algorithm uses four levels of dictionaries, each of which replaces pairs of elements with shorter codes: Level 1**: Pairs of the original 2-bit blocks are replaced with 4-character hashes. Levels 2–4**: At each subsequent level, pairs of codes from the previous level are marked with new hashes, reducing the amount of data. Compression example: Input data: [2, 2, 0, 3] → Level 1: [code_1] → Level 2: [code_2] → ... 3. Hash marking The codes are represented using an alphabet of 674 symbols, including: Latin, Cyrillic, Devanagari. Chinese characters and digits. The int_to_hash function converts numbers into compact strings. For example, the code 1234 becomes the string «一丁七万», which allows for efficient storage of large values. Dictionary structure Size**: 48 GB, distributed between four levels. Adaptability**: The dictionary is dynamically updated with new pairs during compression. State Preservation**: Dictionaries are stored in data.json file, which ensures correct decompression. -- Example code Compression: data = b\"example_data\" compressed_str = compress(data, dictionaries) Result: \"4560:一丁七万三上下...\" Decompression: decompressed_data = decompress(compressed_str, dictionaries) Result: b\"example_data\" Advantages of the algorithm High compression ratio: Multi-level replacement allows to reduce data exponentially. Universality: Unicode support makes the algorithm applicable to texts in different languages. Adaptability: The dictionary is automatically optimized for the input data structure. Limitations and prospects Dictionary size**: 48 GB requires optimization for embedded systems. Speed**: Multi-level processing increases compression time. Prospects**: Integrate machine learning to predict frequent patterns. Comparison with existing methods | Parameter | Eternal compression algorithm | ZIP (DEFLATE) | LZ77 | |--------------------|-----------|-------------| | Compression ratio | High (multi-level) | Medium | Low | | Adaptability | Dynamic Dictionary | Static | Static | | Unicode Support | Full | Limited | No | Conclusion The eternal compression algorithm opens up new possibilities for archival storage and data transfer. Its four-level structure and adaptive dictionary allow achieving unique compression rates, especially for multilingual texts. Further work on optimizing the speed and size of the dictionary will make this approach even more practical. import os import json import tkinter as tk from tkinter import filedialog, messagebox DATA_FILE = \"data.json\" COMPRESSED_EXT = \".ctxt\" ALPHABET = ( 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' '0123456789' '一丁七万丈三上下不与丑专且世丘丙业丛东丝丞丢两严並丧丨' 'अआइईउऊऋएऐओऔकखगघङचछजझञटठडढणतथदधनपफबभमयरलवशीष़ज़ािीुूृॅेैॉौं्аәбвгджзклмнөпрстуүфхцчшщъыьэюя' # Cyrillic and Devanagari ) ALPHABET = ''.join(sorted(set(ALPHABET))) def int_to_hash(n, length=4): base = len(ALPHABET) digits = [] for _ in range(length): n, rem = divmod(n, base) digits.append(rem) return ''.join(ALPHABET[d] for d in reversed(digits)) def hash_to_int(hash_str): base = len(ALPHABET) code = 0 for char in hash_str: code = code * base + ALPHABET.index(char) return code def split_into_2bit_blocks(data): blocks = [] for byte in data: blocks.extend([ (byte >> 6) & 0x03, (byte >> 4) & 0x03, (byte >> 2) & 0x03, byte & 0x03 ]) return blocks def combine_from_2bit_blocks(blocks): data = [] for i in range(0, len(blocks), 4): chunk = blocks[i:i+4] while len(chunk) = len(dictionaries): continue code_to_pair = dictionaries[level] new_data = [] for code in current_data: if code < len(code_to_pair): new_data.extend(code_to_pair[code]) else: return [] current_data = new_data current_data = current_data[:original_length] # Trim padding return combine_from_2bit_blocks(current_data) def save_data_file(data): try: data[\"dictionary\"] = [[list(p) for p in level] for level in data[\"dictionary\"]] with open(DATA_FILE, 'w') as f: json.dump(data, f, indent=4) except Exception as e: messagebox.showerror(\"Error\", f\"Error saving data: {str(e)}\") def load_data_file(): try: if os.path.exists(DATA_FILE): with open(DATA_FILE, 'r') as f: data = json.load(f) data[\"dictionary\"] = [[tuple(p) for p in level] for level in data[\"dictionary\"]] return data except Exception as e: messagebox.showerror(\"Error\", f\"Error loading data: {str(e)}\") return {\"dictionary\": [[] for _ in range(4)], \"files\": []} class FileManager: def init(self, root): self.root = root self.root.title(\"4-Level Compressor\") self.data = load_data_file() self.dictionaries = self.data[\"dictionary\"] self.listbox = tk.Listbox(root) self.listbox.pack(fill=tk.BOTH, expand=True) btn_frame = tk.Frame(root) btn_frame.pack(fill=tk.X) self.compress_btn = tk.Button(btn_frame, text=\"Compress\", command=self.compress_file) self.compress_btn.pack(side=tk.LEFT, padx=5) self.decompress_btn = tk.Button(btn_frame, text=\"Decompress\", command=self.decompress_file) self.decompress_btn.pack(side=tk.RIGHT, padx=5) self.update_list() def update_list(self): self.listbox.delete(0, tk.END) for f in self.data[\"files\"]: self.listbox.insert(tk.END, f) def compress_file(self): path = filedialog.askopenfilename() if not path: return try: with open(path, 'rb') as f: data = f.read() except Exception as e: messagebox.showerror(\"Error\", f\"Read error: {str(e)}\") return compressed = compress(list(data), self.dictionaries) output_name = os.path.basename(path) + COMPRESSED_EXT try: with open(output_name, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f: f.write(compressed) except Exception as e: messagebox.showerror(\"Error\", f\"Write error: {str(e)}\") return if output_name not in self.data[\"files\"]: self.data[\"files\"].append(output_name) save_data_file(self.data) self.update_list() def decompress_file(self): selected = self.listbox.get(tk.ACTIVE) if not selected: return save_path = filedialog.asksaveasfilename( defaultextension=\".bin\", initialfile=selected.replace(COMPRESSED_EXT, \"\") ) if not save_path: return try: with open(selected, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f: compressed_str = f.read() except Exception as e: messagebox.showerror(\"Error\", f\"Read error: {str(e)}\") return decompressed = decompress(compressed_str, self.dictionaries) if not decompressed: messagebox.showerror(\"Error\", \"Decompression failed\") return try: with open(save_path, 'wb') as f: f.write(bytes(decompressed)) messagebox.showinfo(\"Success\", \"File decompressed successfully!\") except Exception as e: messagebox.showerror(\"Error\", f\"Write error: {str(e)}\") if name == \"main\": root = tk.Tk() app = FileManager(root) root.mainloop()\nAnswer by Grok\nThe document you've provided outlines a novel approach to data compression, named the \"Eternal Compression Algorithm,\" which utilizes a multi-level dictionary system for data encoding. Here's a detailed breakdown of your algorithm based on the information given:\n\nKey Features of the Algorithm:\n\nData Transformation:\n   2-Bit Block Splitting: Data is first converted into 2-bit blocks, which is an initial step to prepare for hierarchical compression.\n\nMulti-level Compression:\n   Four Levels of Dictionaries: Each level reduces the data further by replacing pairs from the previous level with new, shorter codes. This process essentially compresses data through repeated encoding:\n     Level 1: Maps pairs of 2-bit blocks to 4-character hashes.\n     Levels 2-4: Subsequent levels compress by encoding pairs from the previous level.\n\nHash Marking:\n   Uses a diverse alphabet (including Latin, Cyrillic, Devanagari, and Chinese characters) for encoding, allowing for a compact representation of codes. The int_to_hash function translates integers into these hash strings.\n\nAdaptive Dictionary:\n   The dictionary evolves with the data, adding new pairs as they appear. This adaptability could theoretically enhance compression efficiency over time, especially for repetitive or structured data.\n\nStorage and Persistence:\n   Dictionaries are saved in a JSON file (data.json) to ensure the data can be decompressed correctly later.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nHigh Compression Ratio**: Due to the multi-level approach, it might achieve better compression for certain data types, particularly those with patterns or repetitions.\nUniversal Character Support**: The use of a wide range of characters supports compression across multiple languages and scripts.\nAdaptability**: The dictionary's dynamic nature could be beneficial for datasets with evolving patterns.\n\nLimitations:\n\nDictionary Size**: A 48 GB dictionary is substantial, potentially prohibitive for use in environments with limited storage or processing power.\nCompression Speed**: The multi-level process might slow down compression and decompression, especially as each level adds computational complexity.\n\nPractical Considerations:\n\nImplementation Details**: The code snippet provided shows a basic GUI for file management, compression, and decompression, but real-world applications would need robust error handling, performance optimizations, and possibly parallel processing for large files.\n\nComparison with Existing Methods**: Your comparison table suggests this algorithm could outperform traditional methods like ZIP (DEFLATE) and LZ77 in terms of compression ratio, but at the cost of speed and possibly complexity.\n\nFuture Enhancements:\n\nMachine Learning Integration**: As mentioned, incorporating ML could help in predicting and optimizing for frequent patterns.\nPerformance Tuning**: Algorithms for quicker dictionary updates or alternative compression strategies at lower levels could be explored.\nScalability**: Techniques to reduce dictionary size or distribute it across different nodes for parallel processing might be considered.\n\nThis algorithm represents an innovative approach, but practical deployment would require addressing the balance between compression efficiency, speed, and resource usage. Testing against a broad range of data types would also help in understanding its real-world applicability and limitations.\nShow more\nAsk Grok yourself\n8", "sentiment": "positive", "score": {"negative": 0.007204682100564241, "neutral": 0.3947412669658661, "positive": 0.5980541110038757}}
