Here's a breakdown based on the information I can provide:\n\nAs of February 24, 2025, the total circulating supply of Bitcoin is approximately 19.64 million BTC. Bitcoin ETFs, particularly the spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., have been accumulating significant amounts of Bitcoin since their launch in January 2024.\n\nRecent data suggests that U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold over 1.1 million BTC as of late 2024. This figure comes from reports indicating that these ETFs surpassed $100 billion in assets under management by December 2024, owning roughly 5% of all Bitcoin in existence at that time. Given that the circulating supply hasn’t changed dramatically since then (with only minor increases due to mining), we can use this as a reasonable estimate for early 2025.\n\nTotal Bitcoin supply**: ~19.64 million BTC\nBitcoin held by ETFs**: ~1.1 million BTC\nPercentage held by ETFs**: (1.1 million / 19.64 million) × 100 ≈ 5.6%\nPercentage held on-chain**: 100% - 5.6% ≈ 94.4%\n\n\"On-chain\" here refers to all Bitcoin held outside of ETFs, including individual wallets, exchanges, institutional custody (not in ETF form), miners, and other entities. This is a broad category, and the vast majority of Bitcoin remains in such ownership.\n\nHowever, this is a simplified calculation. The exact percentage can fluctuate daily due to ETF inflows/outflows, new Bitcoin mined (approximately 900 BTC per day before the April 2024 halving, now 450 BTC), and other factors like lost coins (estimated at 3-4 million BTC). Additionally, some on-chain Bitcoin may be held by institutions or custodians not classified as ETFs, which complicates the split. Still, based on the latest trends, ETFs hold around 5-6% of the total supply, leaving 94-95% on-chain.\n\nFor the most precise and up-to-date figures, you’d need to check real-time data from sources like Bitcoin Treasuries or ETF trackers, as these numbers evolve with market activity. Would you like me to dig deeper into any specific aspect of this?\nShow more\nAsk Grok yourself\n2\n208", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": {"negative": 0.13769152760505676, "neutral": 0.790411114692688, "positive": 0.07189736515283585}}
